# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix hero section text readability and remove the distracting jumping scroll animation.

**Planned changes:**
- Increase the darkness/opacity of the hero section background overlay so all text (heading, subheading, paragraph, CTA buttons) is clearly legible against the background image
- Remove the jumping/bouncing animated scroll text element from the hero section; replace with a static or subtle non-animated alternative if a scroll cue is still desired

**User-visible outcome:** The hero section text is easy to read with strong contrast against the background image, and the section feels calm without any distracting looping or bouncing animations.
